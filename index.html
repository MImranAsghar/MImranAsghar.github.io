		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am passionate about programming and have a growing interest in telecommunications. It is my goal this term to strengthen my mathematics, especially in the area of probability and statistics, because it will help me in solving computer networks and communications problems. My other goal this term will be to become better at leading groups and communicate even more effectively. This will help me in better understading the technological needs of societies. I learned the importance of social skills when I started working with Prof. Mark Fox on a website which highlights restaurants and stores in an area. My teammates and I had lots of discussion on how to portray information and what to include, basically working out needs of foodies. 
<br/> <br/>		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My programming journey started in grade 9, I took computer science courses in all the four years of my high school. Throughout these years, I developed valuable programming skills using Java. I further built upon my programming skills from an introductory Python course in first year at University of Toronto. In addition, I learned HTML, CSS, and JS on courseacademy.com and used them to create a website for University of Toronto Business Association. Working with these languages has given me a deeper understanding of how they are related. 
<br/> <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In second year, I took Programming Fundamentals course as part of curriculum where C++ was used. The main focus of this course was data structures, algorithms and object-oriented programming. This entire process gave me a deep understanding of engineering design and developed my team work skills. By taking a course on computer organization and using low-level languages like Verilog and Assembly, I built a strong understanding of how to write a program that saves memory and program without depending on the libraries. </p>
